# divi-tips-and-hacks
This is a compilation of hacks usable on the Divi Wordpress theme. Unless or otherwise stated, most of the code here should be pasted on your child theme's style.css file or in Dashboard>>Divi>>Theme Options>> Custom CSS section. 


# Hack 1
Whenever your text is breaking. Especially in mobile view. Use this code to wrap the text properly instead of struggling to reduce the font sizes.

# Hack 2
By default, when using the Divi Contact Form, you don't get to see the sender of an email when you receive it. Enter this code in the message box and you will see whoever sent you an email. Edit the Contact Form Module>> Message>> Scroll down to Message Pattern and Paste it there.

# Hack 3 and Hack 4
Helps you to spacefically change the color of the Mobile Menu Toggler. Red is the default, but you can change that to whatever you want.

# Hack 5
Lets you change the active menu item color.

# Hack 6
Helps you totally hide the footer. Now you can go ahead and create your own footer using visual builder.

# Hack 7
With this hack you can create overlapping rows with Divi. From my example, the .top-row class is for the row on top, while the
.bottom-row class is for the lower row that will overlap the top-row. Adjust the -171px to your choice. (Give the classes to your rows and apply the css in Advanced>>Main Element section)
